# Why use Tailwind

- use `npx create-next-app@latest` to generate a [nextjs](https://nextjs.org) app
- open the folder in your code editor and run npm run dev

```html
<h1 className="text-blue-700 text-2xl font-bold">Hello World</h1>
```

# Understanding package in Golang{" "}

The concept of packages in [golang](http://go.dev) has been a big pain to me
as a newbie but to my suprise its really easy

```go

package main

import("fmt");

func main (){
fmt.Println("Hello World")
}

```

```

```
